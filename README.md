Hi, my name is Jakub, I study Computer Science. I'm interested in coding and football. I'm currently learning front-end technologies such as React.js, Redux, SASS and Tailwind.css. Not only am I familiar with the basics of front-end, but also C++ and Python. I'm looking for my first job in IT (remotely or in Bia≈Çystok).
