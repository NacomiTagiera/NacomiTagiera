Hi, my name is Jakub, I'm 20-year-old Computer Science student. I'm interested in coding and football. I'm currently learning front-end technologies such as React, Redux and SASS. Not only am I familiar with the basics of front-end, but also C++ and Python. I'm looking for my first job in IT (remotely or in Białystok).
